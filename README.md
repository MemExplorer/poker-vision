# Poker Vision


Poker Vision is a computer vision project that uses image recognition and optical character recognition (OCR) to identify the cards shown at a flat surface. The project can be used to develop a poker bot that can play the game automatically, or to provide players with real-time information about their hand and the hands of their opponents.

## How it works:

Poker Vision takes a video feed from a camera and uses image recognition to identify the cards on the table. Once the cards have been identified, the project uses OCR to extract the text from the cards, such as the suit and rank. The project then uses this information to identify the players and the dealer, and to determine what type of hand each player has.

## Installation and usage:

Poker Vision is written in Python and uses the OpenCV library for image processing. To install Poker Vision, you will need to install Python and OpenCV. Once you have installed the necessary dependencies, you can clone the Poker Vision repository from GitHub and run the following command to start the project:

Poker Vision will start by identifying the cards on the table. Once the cards have been identified, the project will display the following information:

- The cards of the dealer
- The cards of each player
- The type of hand each player has

## Example:
